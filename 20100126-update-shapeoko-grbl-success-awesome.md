# Update: Shapeoko + grbl = Success! (Awesome)

Here is a short video of ShapeOko drawing a box via grbl and hyperterminal. There is still a lot of work to do before this project is "production" ready. But it's really nice to make some progress every once in a while. The current setup includes: CNC Controller: Arduino running grbl Stepper Controllers: Easy Drivers Stepper Motors: 65oz/in bipolar Linear Rails: Salvaged from previous builds Power Supply: 24v 150W Frame: Custom Designed Laser Cut 1/4" MDF (from ponoko.com) Z Axis Mount/Slide: 3D Printed Custom Design (from shapeways.com) If anyone has an idea as to what is causing the wobble in the y-axis, please let me know. I'm open for suggestions :)
