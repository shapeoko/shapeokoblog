# Scaling the design

I've had a lot of people ask recently what scaling the design to accommodate a larger work envelope would require. Here's an excerpt from an email I sent one of the first people to ask the question. It's an answer in the form of an example: **Scaling: let's say we're going to scale to 33":** 1.) Scaling the Y axis is easy (and cheap!): 

a.) buy 2 pieces of 33" makerslide. Cost: ($8.48 x 2) + cut fee b.) buy 40+" of belting from sdp-si (part #: A 6Z16-C025) Cost: $2.49/ft

2.) Scaling the X axis isn't as easy, but it isn't hard either. The issue that we need to overcome is the static nature of the front/back plates in the standard design (they're only 400mm wide). To accomodate something wider, the easiest solution (besides having a custom piece laser or plasma cut, is to substitute the 10ga steel plate with a piece of 20mm x 80mm extruded aluminium. It's cheap, rigid, and easy to get from [misumi](http://us.misumi-ec.com/)

a.) buy 1 piece of 33" makerslide - Cost: $8.48 + cut fee b.) buy 2 pieces of 20mm x 80mm x 900mm extruded aluminium from [misumiusa](http://us.misumi-ec.com/) (part #: HFS5-2080-900) Cost: $18 each. c.) buy 4 single angle brackets from misumi (part #: HBLSS5-SET) Cost: $1.80 each d.) buy 4 double angle brackets from misumi (part #: HBLSD5-SET) Cost: $3 each e.) for extra points you should buy the end caps for the extrusions: You'll need 8 of them (part #: HFC5-2040-B) Cost: $1.70 each.

That setup will get you a ShapeOko with a 20" x 20" work envelope. _**Here are a couple of disclaimers:**_ _**1.) I haven't actually cut anything with a design this large. In theory the design should be able to handle it, but please keep in mind that some adjustments may need to be made in order to stiffen it up.**_ _**2.) You will want to add another drive to the "dead" side of the Y axis. Right now the single drive works well for such a short span, but anything wider and you'll definitly want to be pushing from both sides. Adding another drive would also require 2 additional idlers, 1 additional timing pulley, 2 additional belt clamps, and an additional 40+" of belting. (That's roughly $50 worth of spare parts.)**_ _**3.) If you do this, send me a picture!**_

**[Jason](#83 "2012-02-01 16:24:12"):** What is the overall volume of the work envelope? I can't find any mention of z-axis travel.
