# Update: Shapeoko + grbl parsing gcode

Here's a video of shapeoko + grbl parsing gcode being streamed from my Dell Mini9. (You can download the gcode below.) Clearly something is not right. However, the job will run identically, which makes me think that it's a simple software tweak as opposed to something more devistating like a hardware problem. Another positive sign is the fact that the z-axis height seems to be working just fine. This particular g-code calls for a clearance height of 6.25mm and a target depth of -1mm. Both of which seemed to be consistent throughout the job.
