The design which incorporates the MakerSlide is well underway! All I can say is this: It's hot!

The current footprint is roughly 15 inches wide x 15 inches long x 12 inches high. This is a little larger than my current mill (+3inches) but still well within the limits of being considered a desktop CNC machine.

<strong>Materials:</strong> we're using delron (black!), mdf, and MakerSlide (extruded aluminum). Although my main focus is on keeping the cost down without comprising performance, I'm also keeping a keen eye on aesthetics. After all, nobody wants a monstrosity sitting on their desktop. Even if it works. With that in mind we've added more rounded corners and given it a smoother finished look.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>A couple of notable features include:</strong></span>

<strong>Method of assembly:</strong> The ever popular tab/slot/t-slot method of assembly! What's that mean? NO GLUE! There's a great<a href="http://wiki.makerbot.com/thingomatic-doc:about-nuts-and-bolts" target="_blank"> tutorial on the process</a> over at the MakerBot site. For anyone who has glued something together and then had to figure out how to change it, you'll appreciate the convenience of a bolt/nut!

<strong>Movement:</strong> The "poor man's rack and pinion" (sorry, I may have made up that term...). This is where instead of running the belt around a set of pulleys, you run the pulley (attached to the motor) across the length of belt. It's a subtle difference in technique, but can yield great results:
<ol>
	<li>Finished belts costs considerably more than unfinished belts ($30 vs $6). By switching to unfinished belts, we'll save $24!</li>
	<li>Finished belts require twice as many pulleys (and twice as much belting) (in our case: 6 vs 3). Pulleys costs about $9 each. Total savings: $27!</li>
</ol>
