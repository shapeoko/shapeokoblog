One of the shortcomings of the current design has has been it's z-axis clearance. Since first mounting a dremel on the front plate it was obvious that I had missed something during the design. The main problem being, after the dremel was in, one needed to run the x-axis all the way to the front in order for the bit to hang over the edge, then you could switch the bit. Otherwise, there wasn't enough room under the dremel to pull the old bit out and slide the new bit in. This, coupled with the fact that at its maximum height, with a standard bit inserted, you could only fit material that was &lt; 0.5".... bummer. I hadn't spend a lot of time trying to remedy the situation because, to be honest, I didn't think it was fixable.

Today, I walked out to the the garage to grab something and happened to glance over at the mill (sitting on the workbench). Pooof, epiphany. Why not flip the tool holder upside down? After all, there is no advantage to having the overhang below the 3D printed part, in fact, it provides a disadvantage because of the verticle space it takes up. So, after the kids were tucked into their beds and my wife was off to see Harry Potter, I went back out to the garage and did just that: flipped it! It's so simple, why hadn't I thought of that 2 years ago!?

You will also notice the full dremel has been swapped out with just the dremel flexible shaft attachment. Seems like that works pretty well, but the "pull" from the cord (containing a worm drive) tends to twist the y-axis ever so much. I'm going to glue in a few gussets tomorrow and see if that helps.

All in all though, tweaking my current design is definitely helping me know what needs to be changed on the next one! You can see here that I ran a bit of hand coded gcode to face a 3"x3" square into some 2" XPS using an 1/8" multi-purpose cutting bit. The results: fantastic! I was overlapping the passes by 1/2 the diameter of the bit, so 0.0625" increments on each pass. The square measured out perfectly after the job finished.

Tonight was a good night.
