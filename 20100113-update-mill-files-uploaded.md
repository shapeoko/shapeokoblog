# Update: Mill files uploaded

After a busy holiday season, it looks like we're back to work: eps files have been uploaded toÂ [Ponoko](http://www.ponoko.com/), and can be found by searching for "ShapeOko". From there you can order. It wasn't exactly necessary but removes one step of the process for anyone looking to build their own mill. Instead of having to upload the files, you can just add them to your cart, and go. Also, the files are freely available to anyone either through ponoko or through the forum here. Does anyone have experience releasing something under an open source license of an sort? After giving this some though I'd really like to get an official release method but don't really know where to start. Suggestions are welcome. Machine progress update: 

  * grbl is loaded on my arduino!
  * replicatorG is loaded up and (hopefully) configured correctly on my PC.
I will have some time tonight to test this out, so everyone please keep your fingers crossed. I'll report back tomorrow.
