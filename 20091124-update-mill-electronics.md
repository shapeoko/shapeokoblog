# Update: Mill Electronics

Have a look at the mill page for a peak at my first schematic! I posted a question yesterday to the sparkfun project forum asking how to connect an 8 wire stepper motor to their Easy Driver stepper motor controller. After a few hours and some really helpful replies, I had my answer! I wanted to try it last night, but ran out of time. Hopefully I can test it out tonight and report back tomorrow on two things: 1.) If it works! 2.) If the motor is strong enough to move the Z axis :) Thanks again to the guys in the forum for their help! Also, I used a program called "Project Draw" from the Autodesk Labs website to draw the schematic. Although I'm more comfortable drawing things in Illustrator, Project Draw works really well. I'm by no means a professional electrical schematic drawer, so I can't attest to how great it is at that, but as far as an easy cloud based way to make a line drawing. It works just fine and has plenty of built in symbols to use. So check it out if you get a minute, you might find it useful as well.
