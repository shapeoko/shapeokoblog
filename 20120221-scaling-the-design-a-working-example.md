# Scaling the design - a working example

It's been incredible (and predictable) how many people want a bigger ShapeOko. Last month, I was contacted by company looking for a solution for "testing" their product. They wanted something to run repetitive testing using a stylus. After finding the project through kickstarter, they gave me a call and we had a conversation about specifics. Fast forward to a couple of weeks ago: I delivered their custom ShapeOko: Based Around 33" Makerslide rails and the appropriate scaling of the front/rear plates. Everything else is "stock" shapeoko with the exception of having two motors on the Y axis. Spanning 33" was something that 1 motor just couldn't handle. After a few inches of travel the "dead" side of the gantry would start trailing behind, making stuttering movements in an attempt to catch up with the drive side. Because the machine is considerably larger than the standard ShapeOko, I had to take over the dining room table for a few nights. The bad part about using the dining room table is that it has to be clean by the time morning comes around. Wives frown on CNC machines invading their dining room :-) So for 3 nights I setup, worked, then tore down... Here are a few pictures of the setup: ![DSC05059](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7002/6719980373_a100cc046f.jpg) ![DSC05058](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6719980167_bd408a1dd0.jpg) ![DSC05057](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7020/6719980001_9df30c0504.jpg) The design considerations for scaling to this degree revolved around the fact they would be using a stylus and not a cutting tool. Because the forces would be lower, flexing of the gantry, or side rails, wasn't a concern. They have not put the unit into production yet, but we'll post back with any information they pass along!

**[David](#85 "2012-02-21 20:54:47"):** This is awesome! I can't wait to get mine. I went ahead and bought some maker slide to increase the length to 24" and the width to 18". Do you thing I will need another motor on the y axis?

**[RSWeaverAz](#115 "2012-06-19 05:37:50"):** I was thinking of scaling up a ShapeOko that would process a 48" sheet of material, and was thinking how difficult it would be to get the steel plates that big ... then I saw an early prototype (i think it was a ShapeOko youtube video) that used a mitsumi 20x80 extrusion as the side plates, I've worked with mitsumi, they shipped the item a 20x40 extrusion cut to custom length in about 10 days. P.S. I just received one of the Inventables $199 ShapeOko mechanical kits.

**[Alex](#114 "2012-06-18 07:05:05"):** Have you considered something like this KickStarter project? http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/openrail/openrail-open-source-linear-bearing-system Should add more rigidness to Y axis.

**[Carl](#108 "2012-04-28 17:01:01"):** If you use a second motor on the y axis, do you use a separate controller for that or do you wire up the the single controller to both motors? Also: are there any considerations to be made for scaling up the Z axis (e.g., doubling it's length)?
