# Questions from the audience

Earlier today I received an email from [Jesse](http://www.facebook.com/itsjesseyo) asking a couple of insightful questions relating to project ShapeOko. Instead of keeping the answers between the two of us, I asked him if it was alright to post his questions along with my answers, for everyone's reference. He agreed. Here is what Jesse wrote: 

> _Hi,_

> _Sorry to be one of the thousands of people asking you the same questions over and over, but I've looked over the whole site and can't find information I need, as I am trying to decide between waiting (an indeterminate amount of time) for the shapeoko or getting the fireball._

> _We are the cutting dimensions? Is adding 3inches to the vertical axis practical? Can you cut aluminum with a dremel-like tool? Are there any small spindles you'd recommend to mill aluminum?_

> _..._

Here is what we told him:

> 1.) We're working on something now to increase the availability of the kit. If all goes well everything will be in place by the end of the month. Come april 1st anyone who wants a machine should be able to place an order and take delivery in an acceptable amount of time. There will be more on that later as the details are straightened out.

> 2.) I can't compare the ShapeOko to a fireball (v90?). As I don't have a fireball and have never really seen one in person. I do know that they look awesome! From the [videos I've watched online](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=probotix+fireball+v90&oq=Probotix&aq=1&aqi=g5&aql=&gs_sm=3&gs_upl=28897l30490l0l32920l8l8l0l0l0l0l163l943l2.6l8l0), I would say comparing the two machines is probably like comparing apples to oranges. The Shapeoko is designed to be an entry level CNC machine that has a low initial cost of entry and gives the user several paths to make their machines better by doing certain upgrades on their own machines. Think of it as "the bootstrap CNC".

> Some compromises were made in order to stay within the project's constraints which make the ShapeOko less robust than what the Fireball v90 appears to be. As always it's a price vs performance situation. I would be doing myself a diservice though to not say I think the ShapeOko is the *best* machine when weighing price vs performance :-)

> 3.) Material: I've cut the following: foam (all types), wood (MDF, pine, oak, OSB, plywood), plastics (UHMW, delrin, HDPE), acrylic (is that plastic?), and I've engraved in A36 (mild) steel. I have a few pieces of aluminium at home but have yet to give them a try. Although, I'm not anticipating any issues with the aluminium, even with the dremel type "spindle". I have seen several videos online showing much less rigid machines milling aluminium without problems. Obviously speed/feed will need to be nailed down.

> 4.) Cutting dimensions: Roughly 200mm x 200mm in the X/Y axis, and about 3.5" in the z-axis. Regarding adding 3" of verticle space: I think that depends what you're going to use the 3" for. If you're thinking about raising the machine up in order to accomodate a taller 3D printing area, then I don't see a problem with that because there are really no *forces* pushing against the z-axis. However, if you're thinking about milling, then I wouldn't advise adding 3".

> Think of the z-axis extrusion (the piece which the spindle mounts to) as a giant lever arm. The further away from the v-wheels you get, the more torque is created. Anything further than about 3" and your torque arm is going to be pretty strong and those v-wheels can only handle so much force in the wrong direction.

One of the things that we've tried to be as straight forward about as possible is to not compare the ShapeOko to any other mill. There are lots of them out there, each offering it's own unique aspect. What makes project ShapeOko different is the cost and straight forward nature of the design. For a pretty thorough list of DIY CNC machines available, have a look at the article ponoko posted a while back.
