There is a point in every projectâ€™s build cycle that puts you face to face with the details you have procrastinated. This is the time that you need to focus, keep scope, budget, and timeframe in mind, and make some tough decisions. For me, this time came over the weekend.

From the time I received the first nest from Ponoko, I started thinking about points of failure and then possible design changes. I plugged away, carefully assembling what I could without fully committing myself. In retrospect, I was just buying time I think, time to convince myself that I should change the design, that I should fix some inconsequential mistakes, that I should start over.

Then I glued the main box together, it scared the crap out of me clamping the pieces together and waiting for it to dry. One thing i really liked about the designed made from steel was the fact that you can unbolt them! With glue... well it's sort of permanent. Everything worked out just fine. So I glued the uprights in place, then I glued the cross supports in place. Then there was only one item left to glue, and I glued it.

Now I'm on to the hard part: The electronics. It's so frustrating/exciting to dive into something you know so little about, it's difficult to know where to start. However, working through the reference material I'm reminded of why I like projects so much: Learning!
