It's been an interesting couple of months, I managed to make it to <a href="http://makerfaire.com/">Makerfaire in the Bay area</a> a few weeks back, which was amazing to say the least. I had the opportunity to meet a whole bunch of really cool people, including Brook (of <a href="http://printrbot.com/">printrbot</a> fame), Nate from <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com">Sparkfun</a>, the <a href="http://fslaser.com/">Full spectrum</a> laser guys, and a couple other notables.

But, best of all, I met close to a dozen members from the forum! That was really cool getting to actually shake hands with everyone and put a face with a name so to speak.

I also spent some time with Bart of <a href="http://buildlog.net">buildlog.net</a>. Bart setup an ORDbot in my booth and spent Saturday and Sunday talking with folks about <a href="http://www.makerslide.com">Makerslide</a> and home CNC in general. He was printing <a href="http://staging.thingiverse.com/thing:2892">giant whistles</a> and showing off some of the <a href="http://www.sotadesign.ca/3d-printing-cnc.php">newer 3D printer controllers</a>. It was really fun.

As mentioned in my <a title="The end is just the beginning" href="http://www.shapeoko.com/archives/739">previous post</a>, I had taken a bunch of orders back in March, just beforemaking the deal withÂ <a href="http://www.inventables.com">Inventables</a>. As such, when it came time to deliver the orders I was running really low on inventory and had some part sourcing issues, by the time all of the orders were shipped it was the end of May! The entire time those orders were waiting to ship, I found it difficult to focus on anything other than shipping the orders. Now that those are gone I feel like the weight that back orders create on my well being has been lifted. (I realize that last sentence was a little dramatic!).

It is very nice to just be a user again and helping to drive the project forward. I have several ideas for improving the machine that have been dwelling in the back of my head for some time. Looks like I'll have some time now to actually test/implement those.

In the meantime the <a href="http://www.shapeoko.com/forum">community over in the forum</a> has been moving the project forward on their own! It's been unbelievable to watch some of the things people have come up with. Here are a few examples.

<strong>Improbable Construct is making signs:</strong>

<strong>Nio made a v-slot table to lock down material.</strong>

This is exactly the type of thing I was hoping would happen once the kits were delivered. I can't wait to see what else happens.

Take care,
Edward
