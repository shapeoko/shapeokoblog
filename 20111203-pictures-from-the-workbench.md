# Pictures from the workbench!

Just wanted to give everyone a quick glimpse into my shop. And by shop, I mean garage workbench. **Here are all the pieces (minus those pesky [delrin nuts](/archives/416)) required to build 20! ShapeOko mills.** [gallery link="file"] There simply wasn't enough room to put all the parts on top of the bench so there are a few "not seen" items: The custom motor mount plates (qty 3 per machine), and the end plates (qty 2 per machine). Both of which are in totes under my workbenches. Tomorrow I'll be setting up a little assembly station in my usual parking spot (can't infringe on [my wife's](http://www.thefordslife.com/) parking space!) I'll be doing all of the assembly and testing over there, pulling parts one set at a time from my main workbenches until there's enough room to relocate back to the workbenches. **A couple of notables :**

  * 87' of makerslide!
  * 320 v-wheels
  * 800 bearings
  * 100ft of 1/4" MXL belting
  * 1000 5mm nuts
  * 1000 5mm washers
  * 500 1/8" #10 spacers

**[Marcus](#80 "2012-01-18 12:47:14"):** Hi. Very interesting project. I might end up buying one :-) Will it be able to cut/mill in aluminum? /Marcus

**[Edward](#81 "2012-01-19 15:23:06"):** Marcus, Thanks for the interest. So far I have not had a chance to test it with aluminium. My guess is that if another motor were added to the gantry (so it was a dual drive Y axis), then yes, at conservative speed and pass depth, aluminium could be cut. I'm planning to test out several materials over the next few months and will be sure to post results when available.

**[David](#82 "2012-01-26 12:05:59"):** Hey Ed, I am a student at the University at Buffalo and I have been working on my own cnc project since last semester. I have had a lot of problems with electronics and hardware glitches and I am seriously considering purchasing your hardware kit, but I have a few questions. First, what is the cut area the machine has in the current model? Also, can this same design be made larger by simply adding a little extra length from the Makerslide (i.e I was looking at 18"x24" I understand that would mean increasing the size of the front and back plates as well, but could that be done without compromising much? If so do you accept custom orders? Sorry for all the questions and thanks in advance! David
