We ended up adding an "in-between" donation level of $100 dollars today in order to give away one of our original ideas: An Arduino pre-loaded with the latest version of GRBL (the world's greatest open source CNC controller!). Combine that with a 3 pack of stepper motor drivers, and you're half way to a complete electronics package (just add power supply and stepper motors).

<a href="http://dank.bengler.no/-/page/show/5470_grbl?ref=mst" target="_blank">GRBL</a> is a free open source CNC controller intended to run on a straight Arduino. We've been using it on the shapeoko project since it's inception, and have been nothing but pleased with both it's performance and ease of use.

As for the stepper motor controllers, we're not 100% sure which brand we'll be sending out, but right now we're leaning towards the new easy driver (<a href="http://www.schmalzhaus.com/BigEasyDriver/" target="_blank">dubbed: BigEasy Driver</a>). We were lucky enough to get our hands on a set a few weeks back and they pretty much kick ass!

However, if you already own an Arduino, or want to try something different, you can substitute that setup with a <a href="http://www.synthetos.com/wiki/index.php?title=Projects:grblShield" target="_blank">grblShield</a> from <a href="http://www.synthetos.com/blog/" target="_blank">synthetos</a>. Just snap it into your existing Arduino and away you go!

Either way, you can tell us which one you want on the post project survey.
