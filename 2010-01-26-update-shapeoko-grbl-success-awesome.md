Here is a short video of ShapeOko drawing a box via grbl and hyperterminal. There is still a lot of work to do before this project is "production" ready. But it's really nice to make some progress every once in a while. 

The current setup includes:
CNC Controller: Arduino running grbl
Stepper Controllers: Easy Drivers
Stepper Motors: 65oz/in bipolar
Linear Rails: Salvaged from previous builds
Power Supply: 24v 150W
Frame: Custom Designed Laser Cut 1/4" MDF (from ponoko.com)
Z Axis Mount/Slide: 3D Printed Custom Design (from shapeways.com)

If anyone has an idea as to what is causing the wobble in the y-axis, please let me know. I'm open for suggestions :)
