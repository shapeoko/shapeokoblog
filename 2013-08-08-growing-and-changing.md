Due to my lack of posting over the last several months, it may seem to the casual observer that the project is stagnant. It's not! A quick look at the <a href="http://www.shapeoko.com/forum" target="_blank">forums</a> and you'll see the community is alive and well and growing.

Last week we tipped 1,000 members in the forum. That's amazing to me. Right now there are well over 2,000 Shapeokos in the wild. With over 1,000 members in the forum that tells me that a lot of people value the community just as much as they value the machine itself. 

I've raved about how great the community is before, but I'll take this opportunity to say again how wonderful they are! If it weren't for the community, this project wouldn't be what it is today: amazing, thriving, scalable, and a perfect example of how open hardware can work if it's done right.

Speaking of growing: the one downside to growth is the requirements it takes to support it. Because of the way the project started, the website was never really planned out. All the things are on the site (landing page, blog, forum, wiki) but it was all sort of haphazardly placed. 

For the last year or so the site has had some intermittent issues. Mostly stemming from poor performance form the server, which was a result of the non-planned expansions. The issues were rare enough that I was OK just letting them go, and restarting the instance when needed (once every few months). However, over the last several months the frequency in which the system went down was increasing. And in the last week it became a liability. 

So, a few days ago I set out to migrate the content to a new server. I won't bore you all with the details of how that went down, but I will say that it was WAY more work than I expected and required quite a bit of quick thinking in order to keep the site mostly up while the transition was taking place. 

Thanks to the help of @bxd, the data is migrated, and the server is purring like a tiger. OK, maybe it's purring like a kitten right now. As far as we can tell it's stable and should be smooth sailing from here out.

So again, I'd like to thank everyone for your patience and thank the community for being awesome enough to require a new server :-) Keep it up.

Happy Milling,
Edward
