Just wanted to give everyone a quick glimpse into my shop. And by shop, I mean garage workbench.

<strong>Here are all the pieces (minus those pesky <a title="A Big Day at Project ShapeOko!" href="http://www.shapeoko.com/archives/416" target="_blank">delrin nuts</a>) required to build 20! ShapeOko mills.</strong>

[gallery link="file"]

There simply wasn't enough room to put all the parts on top of the bench so there are a few "not seen" items: The custom motor mount plates (qty 3 per machine), and the end plates (qty 2 per machine). Both of which are in totes under my workbenches.

Tomorrow I'll be setting up a little assembly station in my usual parking spot (can't infringe on <a href="http://www.thefordslife.com/" target="_blank">my wife's</a> parking space!) I'll be doing all of the assembly and testing over there, pulling parts one set at a time from my main workbenches until there's enough room to relocate back to the workbenches.

<strong>A couple of notables :</strong>
<ul>
	<li>87' of makerslide!</li>
	<li>320 v-wheels</li>
	<li>800 bearings</li>
	<li>100ft of 1/4" MXL belting</li>
	<li>1000 5mm nuts</li>
	<li>1000 5mm washers</li>
	<li>500 1/8" #10 spacers</li>
</ul>
