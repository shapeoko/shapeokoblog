# Kickstarter Update #3

A couple of backers sent me emails asking about acme rods, more specifically, the lack of mention of acme rods in the new design. Here's my take: I love acme rods, they're cheap (6' for about $16), they're accurate, they're easy to find, and they come in a variety of sizes. So why aren't they being included in the new design? A couple of reasons: 

1.) They add components. For each acme rod you use, you also have to use a variety of supporting pieces. Two bearings (one for each end) a coupler to connect your motor's shaft to the rod itself, and an acme nut. The acme nut then requires more pieces in order to be mounted to your machine.

2.) You have to machine them. I'm fortunate enough to have several acquaintances fully capable of turning down a set of rods with almost no runout. Maybe a lot of other people do to, but everyone doesn't, and that's a problem. We want to design something that almost everyone can build so we have to use materials and process that are accessible to almost everyone. Sure, you could use a special coupler like dumpstercnc.com makes, which is acme threaded on one side and straight bore on the other (which is bad ass!) but unfortunately that adds cost and in this game we're trying to cut costs, not add them back in!

If anyone has a great inexpensive method of attaching either a pulley or a straight coupler to an acme rod, let me know what it is and we'll re-evaluate the use of acme rods in the new shapeoko design. Until then, we'll keep drafting our designs around belt driven axis.

As for a coupling, have you come across this? http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9622 nophead is a legend in the RepRap community, pretty much anything he designs ends up as standard! For Prusa it is used for the Z axis but it might be viable for X and Y too.
