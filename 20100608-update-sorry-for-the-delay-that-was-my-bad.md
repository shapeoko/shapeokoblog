# Update: Sorry for the delay. That was my bad.

I thought maybe I would blog about all things Edward. However, it's just not going to work. See that sidebar over there --> Well, that's my streaming life (dare I say my micro-blog) all things Edward that are not DIY CNC related. But as for this blog, going forward it's going back to how it was before the season got nice. Sorry for the mixed messages. It won't happen again. I started working on the machine again. I have a ton of things to talk about but not a whole lot of time tonight. In the meanwhile, here are some pictures.
