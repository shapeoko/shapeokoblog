# Game time!

It's been a wacky couple of weeks for me. In addition to a long weekend spent with my family, and some hectic times at work, I've had to turn my attention to "administrative" tasks relating to shapeoko for the last few weeks instead of progressing on the current build. In the end, I'm positive this is for the better, it was work that had to be done, but not working on the mill for a couple of weeks is still a bummer. We're launching the kickstarter project tomorrow at 12pm CDT, so all of the hard work setting it up will finally come to fruition. However, only time will tell whether or not it's successful. It's funny to think that from the time shapeoko was first accepted by kickstarter until now has been only 7 weeks! On the one hand it seems a lot shorter than that, on the other it seems like it was an eternity ago! There are lots of surprises in store for the project and we've got a couple of special giveaway and a ton of post build options for you to look at. Stay tuned and we'll try to keep you as up to date as we are. Take care.
