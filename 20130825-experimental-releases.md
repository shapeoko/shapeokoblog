# Experimental releases

I spend a lot of time designing new machines. For the last 2+ years I've spent 5-10 hours a week taking a standard set of components (makerslide, fasteners, laser cut steel) and virtually configuring them into new designs via [AutoDesk Inventor](http://www.autodesk.com/products/autodesk-inventor-family/overview). To a small degree, I enjoy the work as it's helped me both hone my modeling skills, and become more familiar with all of the parts. But, by and large I do it because it's the single most effective way for me to come up with design improvements, cost reductions, and new ideas. Going through the exercise of designing something new has yielded several improvements that are evident today. Two great examples are the open end plates and the reconfigured motor mount plates. There are several more (less sexy examples) if you consider things like hole placement, slot sizes, and fasteners! But, I have a confession to make: Even though I'm a staunch advocate of Open Hardware, and the sharing of ideas, I have been reluctant to share my new designs. I could convince myself this was OK, because the weren't released, and I wasn't selling the designs as a product. It's easy to rationalize these sorts of things... But, at the end of the day, I knew I was doing the community a disservice by keeping the designs to myself. So, starting today, I'm implementing a new feature on the website. You will now find a page called **[Experimental](/experimental)**, which will contain, to date, all of my design iterations over the past 2 years. To seed the page, I have added my most recent design, and will systematically work my way backwards until I run out of designs to build. I'm taking a break from new designs for the next few weeks until I get the experimental page brought up to date. For each design found on the experimental page, I will be posting: 

1.) a STEP file in the experimental folder in the Shapeoko github repository.

2.) Details of the design objective(s)

3.) Thoughts on the design (what I was thinking during/after the design was completed)

4.) Links to relevant forum discussions

5.) Any sort of media I have relating to the design.

At the time of this posting, the page is only a skeleton. I'll be adding files, links, and media as time permits over the next several days, with a target completion date around 8/30/2013. I will post back as I make progress. I would like to release the files in as many formats as possible, but due to time constraints and the wide variety of software packages available (and in use in the maker world), I have decided that STEP is the most common format used to share designs. With that said: If you have the ability to convert STEP into a native format (such as Solidworks, Pro-E, Sketchup, or something else) please let me know! I will gladly commit more versions if they're available.
