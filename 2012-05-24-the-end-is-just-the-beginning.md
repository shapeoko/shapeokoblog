I'm done! As of last night, every order I'd ever taken relating to the Shapeoko has been packed, labeled, and shipped. What a relief.

You may be asking yourself what the hell I'm talking about. How could I still be shipping Shapeoko kits? We inked the deal with inventables on April 1st... Well, let's just say that I had some back orders to take care of.

Unbelievably, it's taken me this long to complete all of the orders taken from ordering period March 1 - March 14th. First there was a part shortage, then delays getting the parts back in stock, then one thing, then another. The point of the story is this: That's why I gave up the order fulfillment business. With work, family, 'events', and just maintaining the project, I was burning the candles at both ends trying to get everything done. And when your schedule is stretched that tight, when things don't go as planned (and they seem to never go as planned) one tiny miscalculation or backorder and it screws everything up royally.

I think if I could have buckled down last week, like I thought I was going to, I could have had them all shipped by the time I left for Maker Faire last Thursday. But, that didn't happen. In typical fashion I ran out of M5 x 30mm bolts with a few kits to go. M5 x 30mm bolts are my most common, most used bolts, and I managed to run out of them... I should have implemented an ERP system back in January instead of relying on my spreadsheet.

The good news is this: That's behind us now! Hooray for Time. The bad news is that I have a laundry list of catchup items to take care of. But the good news about the bad news is that I'm looking forward to the laundry list :-)

<strong>Here's what's on the Docket, in no particular order:</strong>

1.) Test the RC spindle.
2.) Test all the different controllers I have with a 'controlled' (no pun intended) experiment
3.) Finish up the quick start guide documentation for all of the users about to receive their machines from Inventables!
4.) Finish building my ORDbot.
5.) Implement the alternative z-axis setupÂ we've been discussing on the forum.
6.) Implement the dual drive (driveshaft) setup we've been discussing on the forum
7.) Finish cutting all of the z-axis plates for the inventables order (that should be done Tomorrow night).
8.) Test EMC2Arduino

OK, so that's not too bad of a list and it all looks pretty fun, so I'm not going to sweat it. One item at a time and it'll be done soon enough.

In the meantime, I've got another project to start.

Take care,
Edward
