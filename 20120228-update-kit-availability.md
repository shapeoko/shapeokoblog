# Update: Kit Availability

**Availability:**  
Another batch of kits will be released for purchase on **March 1, 2012.** Head over to [the website](/purchase) and pick up a kit of your own! Our delivery goal for this batch of orders is to have all orders shipped within _2 weeks_ of their order date.  
  
**Pricing:**  
Pricing for the standard kit will be _$175_ \+ shipping for all domestic orders.  
  
**Community:**  
Nowhere is the word "community" more accurate and apparent than on the [wiki](/wiki). Since our last newsletter, dozens of new pages have been created with lots of new content including pictures and videos. We also spent some time both organizing the sidebar and implementing expandable menus to make the information easier to navigate.  One area that we're most excited about is the [upgrades section](http://www.shapeoko.com/wiki/) of the wiki, where users are submitting lots of ways to make your standard ShapeOko even better. Some excellent examples include: [cable management system](http://www.shapeoko.com/wiki/index.php/Cable_Management), [new belt anchors](http://www.shapeoko.com/wiki/index.php/Belt_Anchors), and an [updated spindle mount](http://www.shapeoko.com/wiki/index.php/Spindle_Mount).   
  
**Information:**  
Last week we started a [github repository](https://github.com/shapeoko/shapeoko) for all of the drawing files related to the machine. We are working hard to get all of the information uploaded and organized so anyone can contribute to the design aspect of the project. If you want to see the machine in action, there are [lots of videos](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL251A73F09D6DA72A) on youtube to keep you occupied until your machine is delivered.  
  
If you have specific questions about the project, and can't find the answer on the wiki, feel free to drop by the [forum]()!  
  
Thank you,  
Edward
