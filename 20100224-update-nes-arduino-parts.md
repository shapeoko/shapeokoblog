# Update: NES Arduino parts

As mentioned last Friday, I went ahead and ordered the male connectors that fit into the female NES controller ends. I just want to note how amazing it is that not only could I find these parts with ease, but that they are very inexpensive and they showed up at my house today. I think the total for 2 connectors + shipping was $4. Simply amazing. [Thanks parallax](http://www.parallax.com/Store/Components/Other/tabid/157/List/0/ProductID/522/Default.aspx?SortField=ProductName%2cProductName)! Here's a picture set of the NES connector. Because I'm not sure where they will be mounted (I havn't designed an enclosure yet..) I used some spare DB9 female connectors to interface with the NES connector, this way I don't have to solder then unsolder/resolder later.
