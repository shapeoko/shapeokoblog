As for the project, I ordered a new spindle today from Paul over at <a href="http://www.cnconabudget.com/">cnconabudget.com</a>. He makes an incredibly cool mini spindle with a tight tolerance and whisper quiet operation.
<a href="http://www.shapeoko.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/3speed_spindle.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-233" title="3speed_spindle" src="http://www.shapeoko.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/3speed_spindle-300x254.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="254" /></a>

There are two versions of the spindle: the standard 3speed spindle ($90) will accept 1/8" bits (standard dremel size bits) and the other features an ER11 collet ($135) which will accept bits from 1/16" all the way up to 1/4"! With budget in mind I ordered the standard 3speed. Paul thinks it should be here before the project ends so maybe we can get a video posted after it arrives!

My thought process was that a variable speed Dremel can be had for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dremel-300-N-Variable-Rotary-Accessories/dp/B000FW5GAM/ref=sr_1_15?s=hi&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1309377216&amp;sr=1-15">about $60</a>. And the wand (flexible shaft attachment) costs <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dremel-225-01-Flex-Shaft-Attachment/dp/B0000302Y8/ref=pd_bxgy_hi_img_c">about $25</a>. So.... the extra $5 seems like a no-brainer. We'll have to work up a mount once it arrives, but from the pictures I'm not expecting it to be an issue. Also, if the specs on Paul's spindle are correct, we'll see some weight savings as well. The reduction in weight may help us with the twisting issues of the Y-axis cross piece that have begun to creep up. Double bonus!

48 hours into the <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/edwardrford/project-shapeoko-a-300-complete-cnc-machine">kickstarter project</a> and we're already close to 1/3 of the way to our goal of $1,500! The generosity and openness of the MAKER community continues to humble me. With emails coming in at a rapid pace since the project's launch, it's been incredibly busy at shapeoko headquarters, but we're trying to answer everyone's questions in a timely manner.
