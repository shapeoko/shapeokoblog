Tomorrow (October 31, 2013) will be my last day as an Inventables employee.

The last 12 months have been unbelievable. In October of 2012, I took a leap of faith, and followed my dream of working on Shapeoko full time. I left my job and decided to make a go of dedicating 100% of my time to the project. It's a decision that I will never regret. For the last 12 months I've worked harder, and with more passion that I ever thought I could.

As many of you know, working for a start-up is non-traditional. The world never sleeps when you're trying to create the greatest "online hardware store for designers" that the world has ever seen. There's always something to do, there is always a new idea, there are always milestones within reach. There is always something amazing happening. It's an amazing invigorating environment to be in. I liken it to what I think the PC revolution was like in the late 70's, early 80's. There's so much going on, from so many different angles, that it's exciting to wake up every day to see what new thing is going to be revealed to the world.

The team at Inventables is AMAZING. They are some of the smartest, hardest working, greatest people I've ever been around. And I will miss seeing them as often as I did. When I started a year ago, we had 7 employees, and when I sat in for my last lunch meeting, we had 15 in the room and one on the big screen via google hangout. It's a company that's found a niche, is growing at a fantastic clip, and is improving itself every day. It's a company that I'm proud to have worked for. I will miss working there.

After 12 months of putting in 110%, every day, I've succumb to the fact that this crazy hectic lifestyle is non-sustainable for me. The office is 105 miles from where I live (one way). I don't go into the office every day. But I do go in a couple of days a week. Sometimes I even stay the night at a buddy's house, so I can maximize my travels and get 2 days of work for the price of 1 day of travel so to speak.

I can work from home whenever I want, and many days I do work from home. But, because of the nature of my position and the nature of my personality, it's difficult for me to be 100% effective from 105 miles away. Lots of times, I need to be in the office so I can build something, or fix something, or meet with someone in person. I need to be in the office to high five my co-workers, and eat lunch with them. I need to be in the office to see the first shipment of a new item I've added to the store. I need to be in the office to meet some unbelievable person who just happens to be stopping by the office. I need to be in the office because I think it's important to be there, putting in work with the rest of the team.

But, being in the office basically erases the rest of my day. Many times, I leave early (around 4am) in order to beat traffic and cut my drive time from 2h 30m to 1h 45m. Many times I would stay in the office until 9, 10, or 11pm, trying to cram several days of work into one.

I loved it. Every second of it. No kidding.

But as they say, you can't have your cake and eat it too. I have 2 young kids (2 and 4 years old), a wife, a house, a dog, friends, hobbies, and many other wonderful things at home and in my life. By going into the office I was was missing a lot of that. Even though it was only a couple of days a week, it is just too much for me.

I know some people who travel A LOT more than I do. And they have kids, and all the rest of the wonderful things that I have and it works for them. But, it doesn't work for me. I want to be home almost every night to tuck my kids into bed, and take my dog for a walk, and spend time with my wife.

<strong>What happens with Project Shapeoko?</strong>

Don't worry, it's not going away! The last 12 months have solidified the project into something that will be around for a long time. We've added hundreds of people to the community and sold thousands of units.

I am not walking away from the project either. I have been organizing the project and acting as the project leader since we launched in June 2011, and I have no plans to change that. However, with so many fantastic members in the community, we have been able to add a structure to the project that it couldn't have had with only one person running it. I am excited to share the details of how the the members are organized within the project, and will save that for a blog post of it's own.

<strong>Thank you</strong>

Before signing off today, I just wanted to say again how fantastic Inventables is for giving me (and the project) this opportunity, and for supporting this (and other) open hardware projects. There are a lot of companies that use open hardware as marketing speak, or because it's a buzzword, or because they think it'll make them look cool to potential customers. But Inventables understands Open Hardware and is doing their best to continue fostering that community, and helping open hardware projects become more available to larger segment of people, all while not loosing site of their Open Hardware core values. Hats off to Inventables for that, it's not an easy job.

Take care,
Edward
