# ShapeOko Survey! (updated with results)

**What a response!** Â  **![](/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/chart_2.png) **

## Comments

**[Jonas](#100 "2012-03-31 02:36:11"):** I might have missed something, but what was the survey question(s) again?

**[Jonathan](#98 "2012-03-31 00:13:52"):** Might help if it didn't say "Access denied" in a bright red box instead of the results :-)

**[Edward](#99 "2012-03-31 00:22:56"):** Changed to an image. Thanks for the heads up!

**[Ray](#104 "2012-04-17 13:08:01"):** Any insight as to how the poll is lining up with the actual preorders? Just curious if the trend is holding true. Congrats on the huge success of the preorders too. Looks like the shapeoko family is about to grow by a factor of 5! :)
