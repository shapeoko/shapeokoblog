I have been working on an assembly manual and a quick-start guide, which will hopefully be turned into a wiki before the project is complete.

It's a little early, because the project isn't 100% complete, but in the spirit of the season I want to send out a *HUGE* thank you to everyone who has helped me get this far. After 3 years of tinkering I can finally see the end of this project. But, if things go well with the forum and the small community that has formed, I'm hoping this is just the beginning of an entirely new project.

Happy Holidays,
Edward
