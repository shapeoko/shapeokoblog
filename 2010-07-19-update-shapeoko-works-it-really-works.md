I spent a little time last night looking over the wiring and found that I had reversed 2Â  wires on each stepper motor........which is why my motors were traveling in the "opposite" direction that I expected. Gotta say, I felt pretty dumb but pretty happy to catch that one.

Tonight I loaded up a gcode file I had created a while back of the sparkfun logo (they have a pretty comprehensive logo page in their about section with a ton of different logos, shapes, etc, etc, in high quality vector (PDF &amp; EPS) files. I used cambam to generate the code (flawless I must say) and have just been waiting to use it.

Turns out that my mill actually works. I shouldn't bee too surprised, I mean after 3 years of tinkering around you'd figure I'd get lucky sooner or later. My next task is to design a dremel mount. At my rate that will probalby take a year, but at least I can draw with a pen until then :-)
