The guys in the Sparkfun forum are really helping me get this thing going! Right now I'm working one axis at a time. Here is my attempt to move the Y-Axis with a 60oz/in stepper and the EasyDriver from Sparkfun.

If you have a listen, it starts out pretty well and then makes this terrible grinding/vibrating noise. I found out that is the motor stalling and/or loosing steps, It's could be from a variety of things, all of which sound pretty managable. I'll try to get it smoother and more consistent.

Although it's not perfect, I'm fully confident this solution is going to work.
