# New End Plates, New Motor Mount Plates

Last July, before [coming on at Inventables](/archives/929) I started selling two "upgrade" plates that I had designed for Shapeoko.

One was a new plate designed to support the ends of the Makerslide that made up the Y axis:

The other was a new plate designed to allow the belt to lay flat on the makerslide (here's an inside view):

**The End plates are designed to support 3 different belt configurations:**

1.) The standard configuration where the belt goes over top of the plate and is pinched down with a mending bracket. The same mending bracket that was included with the kit can be used with the upgraded plates.

2.) Laying the belt (teeth down) on the makerslide and pulling it up through the small slot shown in the first picture.

3.) Doing the S configuration, where the belt is above the plate in the rear, wraps around an idler in front of the pulley, then around the pulley, and flush against the Makerslide.

Another option is to use the [belt clips](https://www.inventables.com/technologies/makerslide-belt-clip) to mount the belting directly to the Makerslide, as shown in the following render:

**The Motor Mount Plates support multiple configurations:**

 I wanted to add another set of holes to the plate design to accommodate the steel wheels that buildlog.net was selling (shown in the picture towards the top of the page). The steel wheels have a smaller diameter, so you can't just swap out the delrin wheels.

In the (super technical) annotated picture shown above, I've highlighted some of the new (and improved!) hole locations:

  * **The blue holes** are for mounting two of these plates together (across a double X configuration). Instead of using the same bolts that you use to attach the wheels, these holes are available.
  * **The Purple holes** are for standard delrin v-wheels.
  * **The Red holes** will accommodate the previously mentioned steel wheels.
  * The slots on the sides can be used to mount limit switches.
  * The long slots across the top can be used to accommodate a double X configuration!
  * The slot on the bottom is to accommodate a soon to be released z-axis re-design (acme compatible)

These plates are really great. I eventually sold out of the batch of plates that I was selling, and in the meantime had some serious issues getting them shipped to where they needed to go.  Since then, I've been trying to bring them into the Inventables store to sell as an accessory for existing Shapeoko owners. It's been a long road, but we are finally getting close. The plates were delivered last week, only to find out they were damaged in transit from the manufacturer. Although they are still functional, the paint is badly scratched and there are large gouges on a lot of them. Here is a  picture of the carnage:

We are in the process of sending the plates back to be re-finished. They've promised a fast turn around so if all goes well, we'll have them in stock (finally!) very soon. Until then, you can sign up to be notified on their respective product pages:
