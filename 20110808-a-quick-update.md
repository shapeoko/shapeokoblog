# A quick update

All, I've been drawing my brains out for the last few days! After 6 years of working on this, things are really starting to move :-) Peter (from <http://www.peterhollis.co.uk/>) was kind enough to do a render that I could show off. There are some details that have been changed since I sent him the step file, but the basic concept is the same. Have a look and let me know what you think.
