I was feeling guiltier and guiltier with every day that went by without an update to the blog. But, when all you're doing is drawing, doing price comparisons, and checking shipping charges, a post on those topics seems less than appealing.

With that said, we want to make sure everyone knows that we are definitely working on the project and making progress towards completion every single day. In fact, we have completed a new digital mill design about every 3 days since the beginning of the project. That's an average.

Without further ado, here are the 7 most recent designs. This render isn't nearly as nice as the one <a title="A quick update" href="http://www.shapeoko.com/archives/295">Peter did for us</a> a few weeks back, but we hope thisconveys the general idea. To give you a sense of scale, the mills are sitting on 2 <a href="http://www.sears.com/shc/s/p_10153_12605_00910132000P?prdNo=5&amp;blockNo=5&amp;blockType=G5">6ft craftsman worktables</a> sitting side by side. As a side note, when I bought those about a year ago, I had dreams of <a href="http://www.shapeoko.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/dream_garage.png" target="_blank">turning my garage into something like this</a>. Let's just say, that is a work in progress :-)

Those are 7 fully detailed 3D models of desktop CNC machines (belts, bolts, nuts, angles, burned edges, etc). Two of the designs we had floating around prior to the kickstarter project, and needed only to adapt them to take advantage of the makerslide linear rail system. As for the other 5, well... those just sort of came up. For the most part, the mills are in order of completed design. With each iteration, you can see it getting a little smaller, a lot sturdier, and a little less expensive. Right now we feel like we're really close to nailing the design and having something physical to show everyone very soon.

From that point, there will still be a lot of work left nailing down final pricing, and ironing out the details. That will be followed by finishing up the documentation, and making some videos on how to assemble and use the new mill. Seems like a lot of work, but we're all feeling like it's right around the corner.

This is getting exciting!
