I have managed to find some time during the holiday season to work on the mill. Here's a recap:
<ul>
	<li>Soldered the EasyDrivers down to a protoboard, and ran the appropriate wires, bringing out the power, step, and dir from each one. I'll get a picture of that up soon.</li>
	<li>Still working on configuring grbl. I've email Simen again trying to clarify a few things. Hopefully he gets back to me soon.</li>
	<li>Posted the updated set of drawing files on the forum (including STEP, DXF, PDF, and the EPS nest.</li>
	<li>Posted link to shapeways</li>
	<li>Looking at embedding a 3D model using <a href="http://labs.autodesk.com/technologies/freewheel/" target="_blank">Autodesk's Project Freewheel</a></li>
	<li>Used <a href="http://www.mynesting.com/" target="_blank">myNesting</a> to product semi-efficient nests. They are in beta now, so all of the nests are free! A very good service if you're looking for a simple nesting solution.</li>
</ul>
