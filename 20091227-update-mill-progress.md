# Update: Mill Progress

I have managed to find some time during the holiday season to work on the mill. Here's a recap: 

  * Soldered the EasyDrivers down to a protoboard, and ran the appropriate wires, bringing out the power, step, and dir from each one. I'll get a picture of that up soon.
  * Still working on configuring grbl. I've email Simen again trying to clarify a few things. Hopefully he gets back to me soon.
  * Posted the updated set of drawing files on the forum (including STEP, DXF, PDF, and the EPS nest.
  * Posted link to shapeways
  * Looking at embedding a 3D model using [Autodesk's Project Freewheel](http://labs.autodesk.com/technologies/freewheel/)
  * Used [myNesting](http://www.mynesting.com/) to product semi-efficient nests. They are in beta now, so all of the nests are free! A very good service if you're looking for a simple nesting solution.
