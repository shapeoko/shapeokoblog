    The layout and styling of this page, and subsiquently the redesign of this site, was heavily influenced by 
    the design of the chartjs.org site. It's beauty through simplicity was too much to resist. I have made slight
    changes so the styling of the site is more inline with the projects styling, but don't want to hide the fact 
    that the styling is taken basically directly from their css file with only minor changes. 
    
    The awesome javascript function that turns H1s and H2s into the navigation is their code as well. 

    I hope this is a compliment to the folks at chartjs.org as opposed to being "not cool"
