Over the last several days I've had quite a few people contact me ragarding the "give-away". To answer the question, here is a a message that I sent out to all donors on Thursday June 30th around 8:30pm.

(this was the message sent to all $100 donors. The text was changed according to donation levels)
<blockquote>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>All,</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I was notified by the staff at Kickstarter today that my reward structure is in violation of their rules. It was a mistake on my part for not looking through the FAQ more closely. About half way down the page, it explicitly states</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"There are some limitations on what can be offered as a reward. Investment and loan solicitations are forbidden, as are lotteries, raffles, sweepstakes, and coupons/discounts on future goods."</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I'm embarrassed about the over-site and disappointed that I didn't recognize my mistake before launching the project. Because of this violation and in order to keep the project running on Kickstarter I have removed the chance to win a mill from all reward levels.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>As a replacement reward for all donations up to this point, you will instead receive personal tech support from me if you decide to build a ShapeOko of your own. Because you donated at the $100 level, you will still receive your promised stepper controllers and Arduino plus personal tech support from me. I'll be available via phone, skype, email, or gchat. After the project has ended I'll send you the pertinent information you will need to contact me directly.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>A lot of people may have donated to the project simply to have the chance of winning the mill, and to all those people; I send my sincere apologies. I want you to know that I respect your option to remove your funding from the project. Details on how to do so can be found here:<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/help/faq#CanICancAPled" target="_blank">http://www.kickstarter.com/help/faq#CanICancAPled</a></em></p>

I have to say that the team over at Kickstarter was phenomenal! They were polite and helpful and supportive throughout the whole ordeal. I really felt like they were trying to help me keep the project alive, even chipping in with ideas for a replacement reward! So, everyone at Kickstarter: A big thank you from the team at Project ShapeOko!

So what does it all mean Bazzle? The short answer is there will be no mill giveaway at this time. Now, that doesn't mean we won't be giving away a mill *ever*, just not while the campaign is running. We're really hoping to start up a small community here at shapeoko.com, so maybe we can use one to get things going!
