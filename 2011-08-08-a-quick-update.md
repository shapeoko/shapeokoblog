All,

I've been drawing my brains out for the last few days! After 6 years of working on this, things are really starting to move :-)

Peter (fromÂ <a href="http://www.peterhollis.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.peterhollis.co.uk/</a>) was kind enough to do a render that I could show off.

There are some details that have been changed since I sent him the step file, but the basic concept is the same. Have a look and let me know what you think.
