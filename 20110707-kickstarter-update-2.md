# Kickstarter update #2

The design which incorporates the MakerSlide is well underway! All I can say is this: It's hot! The current footprint is roughly 15 inches wide x 15 inches long x 12 inches high. This is a little larger than my current mill (+3inches) but still well within the limits of being considered a desktop CNC machine. **Materials:** we're using delron (black!), mdf, and MakerSlide (extruded aluminum). Although my main focus is on keeping the cost down without comprising performance, I'm also keeping a keen eye on aesthetics. After all, nobody wants a monstrosity sitting on their desktop. Even if it works. With that in mind we've added more rounded corners and given it a smoother finished look. **A couple of notable features include:** **Method of assembly:** The ever popular tab/slot/t-slot method of assembly! What's that mean? NO GLUE! There's a great[ tutorial on the process](http://wiki.makerbot.com/thingomatic-doc:about-nuts-and-bolts) over at the MakerBot site. For anyone who has glued something together and then had to figure out how to change it, you'll appreciate the convenience of a bolt/nut! **Movement:** The "poor man's rack and pinion" (sorry, I may have made up that term...). This is where instead of running the belt around a set of pulleys, you run the pulley (attached to the motor) across the length of belt. It's a subtle difference in technique, but can yield great results: 

  1. Finished belts costs considerably more than unfinished belts ($30 vs $6). By switching to unfinished belts, we'll save $24!
  2. Finished belts require twice as many pulleys (and twice as much belting) (in our case: 6 vs 3). Pulleys costs about $9 each. Total savings: $27!
